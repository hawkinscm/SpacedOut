When playing as host to network players, the host IP used will need to be the host IP of your local machine. If you are not behind a router this is the IP that network players will use to connect to you.  If you are behind a router you will need your external or router IP which can be found using http://www.whatismyip.com or by checking your router settings. You will need to make sure that if you are behind a router, you set up port forwarding for ports 55550 - 55558.  The port number will be displayed whenever you select a NETWORK Player Type. Give this port number and the correct IP to a network player to allow him to connect to your game.
